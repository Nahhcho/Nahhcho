### Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jimmy Bonilla
Ever since my first programming course in college I have gained a passion for coding and problem solving, but I want to do more with programming than just course work and theory that I am currently learning. After taking cs50's web development course, I fell in love with building and 
creating, which led me down the road of developing full stack applications using python and javascript. I am always brainstorming for the next project I can work on to showcase the new set of skills I've learned. Whether it be react, django, typescript, or next.js, I want to consume all 
there is to learning about becoming a great developer and engineer so that I can bring value to others through software and solutions. If you're looking for someone with a strong foundation in modern frontend technologies and backend python development, let's connect!
